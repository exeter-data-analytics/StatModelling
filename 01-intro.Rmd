# Introduction

```{r, echo=FALSE}
IMG <- "_img" # image path
```

## Motivation

Scientists acquire knolwedge about the state of nature (the real-world) by collecting data.
For example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="720px"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(IMG, "01-data.png"))
```

How do we make sense of all of these numbers and text? Visualising the data can 
give us a lot of insight into the underlying structure of the data (covered in a previous workshop).
The next step is to *summarise* the data by means of a model. 

## What is a model?

A **model** is a human construct/abstraction that summarises the data. A scientific paper can be used 
as an analogy. The paper together with any supplementary material represents our data, whilst
the paper's abstract is the model; a summarised version of the paper (data)

Developing a model requires us to make **assumptions**. We cannot build models
